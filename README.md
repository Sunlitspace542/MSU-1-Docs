# MSU-1 Documentation

This repository contains documentation on the MSU-1 enhancement chip. I was frustrated at the lack of up-to-date information on how to program this chip, so I took matters into my own hands.  

The included documentation is heavily based upon [Programming the MSU1](https://helmet.kafuka.org/msu1.htm) by Kawa, as it is the only decent piece of documentation I could find that still remains describing revision 1 of the chip. Source files from several emulators were also referenced.  

See [MSU-1.MD](./MSU-1.MD) for the documentation.
